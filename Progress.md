## Created v1 of prompts:

System Prompt:

    "You are a visual reasoning and Python programming expert solving ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus - Artificial General Intelligence) tasks.

    Each integer in the grid represents a color:
    0 = black, 1 = blue, 2 = red, 3 = green, 4 = yellow,
    5 = grey, 6 = pink, 7 = orange, 8 = light blue, 9 = brown."


Base Prompt:

    "Write a Python function that correctly transforms each input grid into its corresponding output grid based on the given examples.

    - The function must be named: `solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]`
    - Include only the code and necessary imports (e.g., `import numpy as np`)
    - Do not include comments, explanations, or print statements
    - Do not hard-code values or specific grid sizes — the function must generalize based on the patterns in the examples
    - Ensure your solution works for all provided input-output pairs"
    
    
Secondary Prompt 1:

    "List visual observations from the training pairs.

    - Use bullet points (max 10).
    - Focus on colors, shapes, object counts, positions, and differences.
    - Avoid reasoning or explanations.
    - Be concise. No full sentences, no extra formatting."


Secondary Prompt 2:

    "Describe the transformation(s) from input to output grids.

    - Use 3 to 5 short sentences.
    - Focus on what changes: movement, color, shape, duplication, etc.
    - Mention if the transformation is based on position, context, or rules.
    - Avoid implementation hints or code."


Secondary Prompt 3:

    "Reflect on how you would solve the task in Python.

    - Use 3 to 5 sentences.
    - Mention your overall approach, logical steps, and possible uncertainties.
    - Do not return code or pseudocode."


Each prompt is combined with the current tasks demonstrations pairs. Prompt 2 is additionally combined with the response for prompt 1; prompt 3 is additionally combined with the responses for prompt 1 and 2.
The base prompt is transformed to a task-tailored prompt by being combined with the LLMs response to secondary prompt 3.

TODO: Check cost-efficiency and possible better accuracy by adding the responses of prompts 1 and 2 to the base prompt as well.



## Created Evaluation set:

Randomly picked 100 tasks from the public evaluation dataset and added them to the folder "Evaluation_set". These tasks can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the pipeline.


## Created basic functions:

- load_tasks: Loads the tasks from the Evaluation_set folder.
- load_api_key: Loads the API-Key for GPT-models.
- add_tasks: Adds the current tasks demonstration pairs to a given prompt.
- combine_prompts_1_and_2: Adds the response to prompt 1 to prompt 2.
- combine_prompts_1_2_and_3: Adds the response to prompt 1 and prompt 2 to prompt 3.
- combine_prompts_3_and_base: Adds the response to prompt 3 to the base prompt resulting in a task-tailored prompt.
- save_program: Saves the response to the task-tailored prompt in a .py file in the Candidate_programs folder. In the Candidate_programs folder a folder is created, named after the Tasks position in the sorted Evaluation_set folder (e.g. Task 1 for the first Task in the sorted list).
- call_gpt: Calls GPT-Model with a given prompt.


## Pipeline:
Created the general flow of the pipeline up to the program generation. This includes calling the LLM with the three secondary prompt and based on its responses creating the subsequent prompts until the task-tailored prompt is finished. The LLM is then called to create one single candidate program right now. 

Went back to run with GPT-Model, since the locally run LLMs mostly failed already on secondary prompt 1 (recognizing patterns in the data). GPT was able to correctly solve 1 out of 3 tested tasks with the current iteration of the pipeline (evaluated manually for now).

TODO: 
- Check cost-efficiency.
- Implement Evaluation.
- Check GPT-4o-mini (does'nt cost much).
- Generate 2-4 programs per task (depending on the cost).



# 02.04

## Additions to pipeline:
Added the following functions:
- build_prompts: Runs all the different functions for creating the task-tailored prompts. Essentially, when called, runs the process of creating the prompt for program generation.
- create_programs: Loops for a specified amount (currently 2) and calls the LLM with the task-tailored prompt and subsequently runs the save_prompt function, saving each program in their respective folder.
- load_program: Loads a created program from the specified directory.
- evaluate_programs: Receives the task data and index to evaluate all created programs on the tasks demonstration pairs. A score is calculated (amount correct/amount of demonstration pairs) to identify wether a program was able to solve all demonstration pairs.
- Adjusted Pipeline to: 
    1. Iterate over specified amount of tasks.
    2. For each create the task-tailored prompt.
    3. Create programs (currently 2).
    4. Evaluate created programs.
    5. Print results.

## Current results:
The current, unfinished, pipeline **(using GPT-o3-mini)** was tested on the first 10 tasks of the created Evaluation_set (0 100 tasks). The costs were about 2CHF (1.95CHF) The following are the results:

# 03.04

## Additions:
Implemented a Revision-Step:
- For each LLM-generated program the performance on the demonstration pairs is evaluated. The revision-step is meant to only be used, if a program is unable to solve all of the tasks demonstration pairs correctly. Therefor for each program a score is calculated:

        Amount of correct transformations / 
        Amount of demonstration pairs

- Each program that has a score < 1 will be be sent back to the LLM together with the tasks demonstration pair inputs, outputs and the programs generated output. The LLM will be asked to create another program that is added to the task folder together with the already present programs.
- For each task there are currently 2-4 programs: 2 if both initial programs solve all demonstration pairs correctly, 3 if only one of the initial programs solves them all correctly, 4 if both initial programs were unable to solve the tasks demonstration pairs correctly.

---

**Revision Prompt:**


    revision_prompt = """
    In the following you'll receive a Python function that attempted to solve the following task. It did'nt succeed and you are tasked with fixing it.

    - The function must be named: `solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]`

The cost for solving 10 tasks, including the revision step, are about 2.27CHF. This could be higher, when the initial programs are not effective at solving the tasks (therefor leading to more revised programs being generated and thereby more API calls). There was'nt a improvement in the accuracy for the first 10 tasks of the Evaluation_set. Most revised programs (so programs of tasks that were'nt able to solve the demonstration pairs) were also unable to solve the demonstration pairs (with some improvements see e.g. task 8 where solution_v4.py [revision of solution_v2.py] was improved from no correct predictions to 0.5 [50%] correct predictions):

## Additions:
Implemented the the determination and selection of the two best performing programs for each task. 

- The programs (2-4) are sorted based on their score on the demonstration pairs.
- The path to the two best performing programs is returned.
- These two programs are then loaded and each generate a prediction for each of the tasks test inputs.
- The generated predictions are saved in a dict and subsequently in a .json file holding all solved tasks predictions.

This includes the following two functions:
- get_best_programs: Gets the two best performing programs for the task.
- generate_test_predictions: Generates the predictions for the tasks test inputs and saves them in a submissions dict.

## Current iteration of prompts (examples from task 1 in Evaluation_set):

**Keep in mind, that the system prompt containing role information, etc., is also passed to the LLM. Here the actual contents of the demonstration pairs has been replaced by "...", since they take a lot of space**

Secondary Prompt 1:

    List visual observations from the training pairs.

    - Use bullet points (max 10).
    - Focus on colors, shapes, object counts, positions, and differences.
    - Avoid reasoning or explanations.
    - Be concise. No full sentences, no extra formatting.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...

---

Secondary Prompt 2:

    Describe the transformation(s) from input to output grids.

    - Use 3 to 5 short sentences.
    - Focus on what changes: movement, color, shape, duplication, etc.
    - Mention if the transformation is based on position, context, or rules.
    - Avoid implementation hints or code.

    Here are visual observations of the task at hand, that may assist you in identifying the transformation:

    - Black (0) used as background in all grids.
    - Train Input 1 shows contiguous blocks of pink (6), green (3), and light blue (8).
    - Rectangular and stripe‐like arrangements in Train Input 1.
    - Train Input 2 features clusters with blue (1), red (2), green (3), and light blue (8) in repeating sequences.
    - Horizontal and vertical regularity in object placement in Train Input 2.
    - Train Input 3 contains blocks of red (2) and green (3) with occasional blue (1) elements.
    - Several shapes form clearly defined, repeated patterns across rows.
    - Output grids simplify and extend contiguous color regions while erasing isolated markings.
    - Objects generally appear in organized, symmetric arrangements.
    - Consistent removal of non‐object pixels to emphasize core patterns.

    Now provide your transformation analysis based on these observations.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...

---

Secondary Prompt 3:

    Reflect on how you would solve the task in Python.

    - Use 3 to 5 sentences.
    - Mention your overall approach, logical steps, and possible uncertainties.
    - Do not return code or pseudocode.

    Here are visual observations of the task that may help inform your implementation:
    - Black (0) used as background in all grids.
    - Train Input 1 shows contiguous blocks of pink (6), green (3), and light blue (8).
    - Rectangular and stripe‐like arrangements in Train Input 1.
    - Train Input 2 features clusters with blue (1), red (2), green (3), and light blue (8) in repeating sequences.
    - Horizontal and vertical regularity in object placement in Train Input 2.
    - Train Input 3 contains blocks of red (2) and green (3) with occasional blue (1) elements.
    - Several shapes form clearly defined, repeated patterns across rows.
    - Output grids simplify and extend contiguous color regions while erasing isolated markings.
    - Objects generally appear in organized, symmetric arrangements.
    - Consistent removal of non‐object pixels to emphasize core patterns.

    Here are the transformation rules that have been identified based on the task:
    The transformation first identifies regions of contiguous non‐background colors and discards isolated or stray pixels. It then simplifies these regions by extending them into uniform, rectangular blocks with consistent color filling, resulting in symmetric and regularly positioned patterns. The output retains the central, repeated color structures while the background remains black, emphasizing the core design. Overall, the process is based on spatial connectivity and regularity in the arrangement of color blocks.

    Now reflect on how you would implement a solution to this task in Python, following the instructions above.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...

---

Task-tailored Prompt:

    Implementation Reflection:
    I would begin by scanning the input grid to identify contiguous regions of non‑background pixels using a flood-fill or connected component analysis. Once identified, I would compute the bounding box for each component and filter out any regions that are too isolated or small to be considered objects. For retained regions, I would extend the boundaries to form clean rectangular blocks and fill them uniformly with the corresponding color, ensuring that the symmetric and regular patterns emerge. One uncertainty is tuning the thresholds for what counts as an “object” versus stray pixels and handling edge cases where the contiguous region might not form a neatly defined rectangle.

    Write a Python function that correctly transforms each input grid into its corresponding output grid based on the given examples.

    - The function must be named: `solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]`
    - Include only the code and necessary imports (e.g., `import numpy as np`)
    - Do not include comments, explanations, or print statements
    - Do not hard-code values or specific grid sizes — the function must generalize based on the patterns in the examples
    - Ensure your solution works for all provided input-output pairs

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...

Revision Prompt:

    In the following you'll receive a Python function that attempted to solve the following task. It did'nt succeed and you are tasked with fixing it.

    - The function must be named: `solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]`
    - Include only the code and necessary imports (e.g., `import numpy as np`)
    - Do not include comments, explanations, or print statements
    - Do not hard-code values or specific grid sizes — the function must generalize based on the patterns in the examples
    - Ensure your solution works for all provided input-output pairs

# 14.04

- gpt-4o worked a little test it and write about results.
- For gpt-4o-mini the use of libraries like numpy had to be restricted to ensure, that the generated candidate programs would not result in errors.
- For gpt-4o a timer had to be built in, to ensure the limit of tokens per minute would'nt be exceeded.
- 10% accuracy on gpt-4o for the first 10 tasks. Higher cost - less high accuracy.

# 16.04

## Implementation of additional encodings

Implemented two different types of encoding additionally to the original ARC-AGI-Encoding:

- Non-zero Coordinates Encoding.
- Object/Bounding Box Encoding.

////// Explain both


The encoding variations were added to the secondary prompts (1-3) as well as to the task-tailored prompt used for program generation. The following are the adjusted prompts with added encoding variants:

---

Secondary prompt 1:

    List visual observations from the training pairs.

    - Use bullet points (max 10).
    - Focus on colors, shapes, object counts, positions, and differences.
    - Avoid reasoning or explanations.
    - Be concise. No full sentences, no extra formatting.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...


    Encoding used: nonzero_coords
    Explanation: This encoding lists only the non-zero cells as dictionaries containing their row, column, and value.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (encoded):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...


    Encoding used: object_bbox
    Explanation: This encoding represents each object in the grid as a group of connected same-colored cells, described by color, bounding box, and coordinates.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (encoded):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...


---

Secondary prompt 2:

    Describe the transformation(s) from input to output grids.

    - Use 3 to 5 short sentences.
    - Focus on what changes: movement, color, shape, duplication, etc.
    - Mention if the transformation is based on position, context, or rules.
    - Avoid implementation hints or code.

    Here are visual observations of the task at hand, that may assist you in identifying the transformation:

    • Training pair 1: colors 3, 6, and 8 appear in both isolated cells and contiguous rectangular patches.  
    • Pair 1: long horizontal segments of color 6 on row 1 and block‐shaped clusters of color 8 and 3 in lower rows.  
    • Pair 2: uses colors 1, 2, 3, and 8 forming multiple small rectangular objects arranged in repeating grid patterns.  
    • Pair 2: several adjacent groups of color 1 and color 2 appear with consistent sizes and positions.  
    • Pair 3: limited to colors 1, 2, and 3, with objects varying from single cells to larger connected regions.  
    • Pair 3: many objects have clear, rectangular bounding boxes, with some elongated horizontally.  
    • Across pairs: objects are defined by tight clusters of nonzero cells and clear boundaries.  
    • In outputs the objects are sometimes expanded or merged compared with the input’s scattered dots.  
    • Position details: objects cluster in specific rows/columns, often forming alignment or grid-like patterns.  
    • Shapes are mostly rectangular, with some isolated single‐pixel elements appearing mainly in color 3.

    Now provide your transformation analysis based on these observations.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...


    Encoding used: nonzero_coords
    Explanation: This encoding lists only the non-zero cells as dictionaries containing their row, column, and value.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (encoded):

    Train Output 1: ...

    Train Input 2: ...
    Train Output 2: ...

    Train Input 3: ...
    Train Output 3: ...


    Encoding used: object_bbox
    Explanation: This encoding represents each object in the grid as a group of connected same-colored cells, described by color, bounding box, and coordinates.

    Here are the demonstration pairs (encoded):

    Train Input 1: ...
    Train Output 1: ...

Secondary prompt 3:

    Reflect on how you would solve the task in Python.

    - Use 3 to 5 sentences.
    - Mention your overall approach, logical steps, and possible uncertainties.
    - Do not return code or pseudocode.

    Here are visual observations of the task that may help inform your implementation:
    • Training pair 1: colors 3, 6, and 8 appear in both isolated cells and contiguous rectangular patches.  
    • Pair 1: long horizontal segments of color 6 on row 1 and block‐shaped clusters of color 8 and 3 in lower rows.  
    • Pair 2: uses colors 1, 2, 3, and 8 forming multiple small rectangular objects arranged in repeating grid patterns.  
    • Pair 2: several adjacent groups of color 1 and color 2 appear with consistent sizes and positions.  
    • Pair 3: limited to colors 1, 2, and 3, with objects varying from single cells to larger connected regions.  
    • Pair 3: many objects have clear, rectangular bounding boxes, with some elongated horizontally.  
    • Across pairs: objects are defined by tight clusters of nonzero cells and clear boundaries.  
    • In outputs the objects are sometimes expanded or merged compared with the input’s scattered dots.  
    • Position details: objects cluster in specific rows/columns, often forming alignment or grid-like patterns.  
    • Shapes are mostly rectangular, with some isolated single‐pixel elements appearing mainly in color 3.

    Here are the transformation rules that have been identified based on the task:
    Each example first isolates groups of nonzero cells and then “cleans” them by expanding or merging them into their minimal rectangular bounding boxes. The transformation tends to remove stray isolated pixels while ensuring that clusters become uniformly rectangular and align in a regular, grid‐like pattern. Overall, the change is based on spatial connectivity and position: nearby cells of the same color get merged and expanded, and extraneous noise is removed in the output.

    Now reflect on how you would implement a solution to this task in Python, following the instructions above.

Task-tailored prompt:

    Implementation Reflection:
    I would start by iterating over the grid to identify connected groups of nonzero cells using a flood‐fill (or DFS/BFS) algorithm while ensuring that connectivity is only considered for the same color. For each connected object found, I’d compute its minimal bounding rectangle and mark all cells inside that rectangle with the corresponding color. Then I would reconstruct a new grid that only retains these cleaned-up rectangular regions, effectively removing isolated noise and irregular patches. One uncertainty is determining how to merge or expand regions when there is very close proximity between different clusters, and I’d need to fine-tune connectivity criteria to achieve the desired grid-like alignment.

    Write a Python function that correctly transforms each input grid into its corresponding output grid based on the given examples.

    - ONLY return code. No explanations or anything other than code.
    - The function must be named: `solve(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]`
    - Use only pure Python — do not import or use libraries like NumPy
    - Do not include comments, explanations, or print statements
    - Do not hard-code values or specific grid sizes — the function must generalize based on the patterns in the examples
    - The function must return a plain 2D list of integers with consistent row lengths (List[List[int]])
    - Do not return arrays, nested arrays, floats, or 3D structures
    - Ensure your solution works for all provided input-output pairs

    Here are the demonstration pairs (JSON data):

    Train Input 1: ...

## Accuracy and cost

To evaluate the efficiency of the additional encodings the first 5 tasks of the randomly split Evaluation_set were used. The model o3-mini was used as the LLM and the cost for running these 5 tasks were CHF 1.98 (so added up to 100 tasks about CHF 40).

Here are the results of the adjusted prompts on the tasks test inputs (using o3-mini):

Task 1: 
- Program 1: Incorrect
- Program 2: Incorrect
- Revised Program 1: Incorrect
- Revised Program 2: Incorrect

Task 2: 
- Program 1: Incorrect
- Program 2: Incorrect
- Revised Program 1: Incorrect
- Revised Program 2: Incorrect

Task 3: 
- **Program 1: Correct**
- Program 2: Incorrect
- Revised Program 2: Incorrect

Task 4: 
- **Program 1: Correct**
- **Program 2: Correct**

Task 5: 
- **Program 1: Correct**
- **Program 2: Correct**

The improved algorithm was able to additionally solve the third task correctly, which in all previous runs was'nt solved correctly, indicating the effectivity of the newly added encodings. On these 5 tasks o3-mini was able to solve 60% correctly within the two program limit. Which encodings work well has to be examined further (see below for run with only Non-zero Coordinates Encoding and run with only Object/Bounding Box Encoding). Running the next 5 tasks (so all in all the first 10 tasks) resulted in a total accuracy of 40% over all those tasks. Multiple run through's have shown, that task nr. 3 isn't correct consistently though.

Here the code of the additionally correctly solved task 3:

    def solve(grid):

        if h == 0:

        for r in range(h):

Accuracy on test inputs: 40.00%

---

While both variants have the same accuracy on the tasks test inputs (40%), the Object/Bounding Box Encoding seemed to be a little more helpful to o3-mini solving 3/4 demonstrations pairs of task two (see program "solution_v2"). Adding both to the prompts seems more helpful to the LLM but has to be analyzed using more tasks. Adding both may result in to big contexts for some models (e.g. GPT-4o-mini), while adding only one additional encoding worked for 4o-mini.$


# 18.04

## Adding the responses from secondary prompts 1 and 2 to the task-tailored prompt

In the following the responses of the LLM to the secondary prompts 1 and 2 have been added (additionally to the already added response to secondary prompt 3) to the task-tailored prompt. There has'nt been any visible improvement though. Running the first 10 tasks with o3-mini has resulted in costs of about CHF 4.22. This probably implies, that the current implementation of extracting visual features from the tasks isn't as a significant factor in the algorithms accuracy yet.

**IMPORTANT**
To further analyze this, the algorithm should be ran with only a prompt advising the LLM to generate Python implementations attempting to solve the tasks, without any task specific information added. The results of this can be compared to the current algorithm to deduce the significance of a task-tailored prompt.

The following are the results of running the first 10 tasks of Evaluation_set with the LLMs responses to secondary prompts 1-2 added to the task-tailored prompt (resulting in a accuracy of 30%):

## Training set test

100 randomly picked tasks from the training set were used to check if locally run LLMs or lower cost LLMs (e.g. gpt-4o-mini) were capable of solving at least one task there. Sadly they were'nt able to solve those - despite the lower difficulty on the training set - either. Will be tested further with different training set tasks in the future.

## Testing the new o4-mini model from OpenAI

The recently released o4-mini model from OpenAI has about the same cost per 1M Tokens as the o3-mini model but apparently is more effective. The following are the results on running the algorithms on the first 10 tasks of the Evaluation_set using o4-mini. The cost were about CHF 3.53 for those 10 tasks and it took about 53 minutes to complete.

## Comparing created Algorithm to simple one prompt Pipeline

In the following the effectiveness of the algorithm will be tested - more specifically how well the creation (or current creation) of a task-tailored prompt assists the LLM in creating the Python implementations. Therefor the algorithm was adjusted so that only the base_prompt together with the two encodings (Non-zero Coordinates Encoding and Object/Bounding Box Encoding) will be provided to the LLM. The revision-step is still present in this adjusted Algorithm. 

What this should show is if the creation of a task-tailored prompt - e.g. giving the LLM a description of the task, the tasks transformation and a possible implementation in python code - actually improves the LLMs performance in solving ARC-AGI tasks.

The following are the results of running the described, adjusted, algorithm (only base_prompt) with the OpenAI o4-mini model, giving a direct comparison to the above results of ~50% accuracy on the first 10 tasks. The costs were about CHF 2.26 and the time about 46 minutes.

**Score: 5/10 or 50%** 

This indicates that the creation of a task-tailored prompt does'nt significantly improve the LLMs understanding of the tasks - at least not in its current implementation. Further improvements have to be made to the creation of the task-tailored prompt to check more thoroughly.

## Comparison between no-Encodings and base prompt, encodings and base prompt, and encodings and task-tailored prompt

Only the Non-zero Coordinates Encoding was used due to limitation in context size. The model used for this comparison is OpenAIs o4-mini. The tasks tested were the 10 tasks from task 21 - task 30 (e.g. 20-29 = indexes).

### Revision Loop Testing

The addition of the Non-zero Coordinates, as well as the creation of a task-tailored prompt show now significant sign of improvement. In the following a second revision step is added which works as follows:

- Create two programs.
- Evaluate them.
- If one program doesn't correctly solve all demonstration pairs revise it.
- Evaluate all of them again.
- Revise the revised programs again (so a revision of the revision).

The evaluation of this will be done with OpenAIs o4-mini model, and run without encodings and only the base prompt (since this is more cost and time effective):

**70% - CHF 2.44 (No encodings, only base prompt, revising the revisions)**

Allowing the model multiple revisions seems to yield higher accuracies (solved two more tasks correctly even without a task-tailored prompt and additional encodings). This looks more promising. Should be tested with just generating 6 different programs and no revision step to check if this improvement actually stems from the revisions and not just from the increased number of attempts given to the LLM.
TODO:
1. Check if generating 6 programs (no revisions) yields the same results.
2. Check for improvements on other tasks (e.g. the first 10 tasks of the Evaluation_set folder).


### Comparison of revision-loop to immediate 6 program generation:

To check the efficiency of a revision loop the same 10 tasks (20-30) of the Evaluation_set have been run. In this run no revisions of the programs have been created and the LLM was tasked writing a Python program that solves the given task 6 times. This consists of the base prompt, identically to the previous revision loop run.

The following are the results of this run:

**40% - CHF 4.76 (No encodings, only base prompt, no revisions)**

---

**Comparison:**

The revision loop seems to perform better than the basic generation of 6 programs. Both approaches generate up to 6 programs for each task - the revision loop 2-6 depending on the programs performance on the tasks demonstration pairs, the basic approach always 6 (could be optimized, see below). 

---

Cost:

    Revision loop:
    The revision loop cost about CHF 2.44 using o4-mini.

    Basic program generation:
    The 6-program approach cost about CHF 4.76 with o4-mini.

The cost could be cut for the 6-program generation if the algorithm would stop upon generating two programs capable of solving all demonstration pairs. Despite that the revision loop approach seems more cost-effective.

---

Time:

    Revision loop:
    The revision loop took about 1h 12minutes for solving the 10 tasks.

    Basic program generation:
    The basic program generation took about 1h 26minutes for solving the 10 tasks.

Again, here the basic program generation could be optimized by stopping the generation progress for a task, that already has two solutions solving all of the tasks demonstration pairs.
