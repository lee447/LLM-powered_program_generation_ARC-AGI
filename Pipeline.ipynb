I would first analyze each row and column to detect consecutive sequences or clusters of colors, then use conditions to filter out unwanted colors (like isolated greens in one case, or blue and red in another) or to retain larger contiguous blocks. I would assume that the observed patterns in the examples reliably indicate the general rules, though I’d also plan to handle edge cases like very small regions or unexpected color configurations by building in checks for grid boundaries and consistency.\n",

      "Here are the transformation rules that have been identified based on the task:\n",
      "In the first pair, the transformation removes many individual colored marks—especially along the borders—by replacing them with black, while preserving broad horizontal blocks of pink and light blue in the center and leaving only a few isolated greens. In the second pair, the process filters out blue and red elements so that only the green and light blue clusters remain clearly visible; several rows that originally had patterned details are entirely black in the output. In the third pair, most of the grid is converted to a uniform black background with the exception of central, well‐aligned horizontal stripes of red and green that are maintained, effectively removing extra or noisy colored details from the periphery.\n",
